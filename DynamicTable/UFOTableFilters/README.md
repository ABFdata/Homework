# Unit 14 | JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

# Background

#### For this project I created several dynamic tables to display eye-witness reports of UFO sightings. The following tables can be sorted as such:

Level 1: [Automatic Table](https://github.com/ABFdata/Homework/blob/master/DynamicTable/UFOTableFilters/1date_index.html) and Date Search. This table allows you to filter the table by date. 
    

Level 2: [Multi Category Search](https://github.com/ABFdata/Homework/blob/master/DynamicTable/UFOTableFilters/2multi_category.html) This table allows you to search by multiple categories.

Level 3: [Pagination](https://github.com/ABFdata/Homework/blob/master/DynamicTable/UFOTableFilters/3pagination.html) This table loads the first 50 rows of the data set with the option to load more data with a button at the bottom. 

Level 4: [Multi Category Search Pagination](https://github.com/ABFdata/Homework/blob/master/DynamicTable/UFOTableFilters/4multi_pagination.html) This table incorporates one search bar that allows you to filter by all the categories. The table also incorporates pagination, with the first 50 rows of data.
