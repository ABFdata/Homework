WeatherPy Insights:

1. The latitude vs temperature chart tells us that cities at the equator have the highest temperatures. What's intersting however, is that cities in the North Pole have colder temperatures than cities in the south pole. 

2. The latitude vs humidty chart tells us that humidty levels seem pretty consistent between -50 and 75 degrees latitude. Cities between -25 and the equator seem to be humid reaching humidty levels from 80 - 100%.

3. The latitude vs wind speed chart shows us some intersting outliers.  The south pole below -50 latitude has wind speeds close to 35 mph. Most of the cities in the chart have wind speeds between 0-10 mph.
