Week 3 Homework
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
You will be given two sets of revenue data (`budget_data_1.csv` and `budget_data_2.csv`). 
Each dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Revenue`. 
(Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
